## Topic: 
After some discussion, we decided to change our topic to wars in history. The war data are available at  (Links to an external site.)http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/COW-war from Correlates of War (COW) project.

We are most interested in the Inter-state wars and Intra-state (Civil) wars. By looking at both intra and inter data sets, we found they both include variables such as war name, war type, state name, duration (start time and end time), war location, outcome, number of deaths.

Some questions we would like to answer or explore through exploratory data visualization include comparing number of deaths before and after a specific year like 1945, if there are differences in the number of deaths between the initializing states and invaded states, and which reason causes most wars.

The data set is extremely clean with a code-book but variables are limited. We will combine other economics data sets to explore more topics, such as the changes of economic indicators during the war and how long it took for a state/country to recover from the war.
